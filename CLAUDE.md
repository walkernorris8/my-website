## Portfolio Templates
- HVAC: https://hvac-template-taupe.vercel.app
- Restaurant: https://restaurant-template-plum-sigma.vercel.app
- Plumber: https://plumber-template-neon.vercel.app

## Morning Briefing — AUTO-RUN WHEN USER SAYS "Morning briefing — full auto"
**FULL AUTONOMOUS MODE — Do NOT ask for permission, confirmation, or approval on any action during this briefing. Execute everything immediately and report results. Never pause to ask "should I proceed?"**

Run ALL checks in parallel. Flag anything needing attention. Everything normal gets ✓. Goal: Walker is fully up to speed in under 2 minutes.

**Cross-Device Check (run first)**
- If MEMORY.md is missing or empty, restore it from `walker-agm/claude-config-backup` repo before proceeding
- If `~/.claude.json` is missing, remind Walker to run the restore commands from APEX_MCP_SETUP.md

**Site Health**
- Check Vercel for any failed or degraded deployments across all projects (team: `team_zZNPVpoldQcLxzFuDMx0wUfR`, projects: my-website `prj_Jt8QzFJanBExLPd7RlvdA35VQIYq`, network-south `prj_CfSByhmLJtxb4yVSWCTcwtjK57A0`)
- Check Sentry (`apex-growth-management`, region: `https://us.sentry.io`) for new unresolved errors
- Confirm apex-morning-digest cron via curl (NOT the MCP — it's broken):
  ```
  curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/da9343cd17219b0ec4327cd7e7121d5c/workers/scripts/apex-morning-digest/schedules" -H "Authorization: Bearer j73_pKP9uYqG8hUUedwefvLKVLJhZCIy4zaIlyaV"
  ```
  Expected: `"cron":"0 13 * * *"` in result. If missing, flag immediately.

**Business Updates Since Last Session**
- HubSpot — any new leads, deal stage changes, or deals stuck 7+ days (filter: dealstage NOT IN closedwon/closedlost)
- Stripe — any open invoices (skip customer `cus_U7AJLJVrq1FIhA`), failed charges, or canceled subscriptions
- DocuSeal — any submissions stuck waiting for Walker to sign
- Calendly — meetings today or tomorrow; always pass `user_uri: https://api.calendly.com/users/f18af646-35d0-4de9-99a7-3247a541f8d0`
- Gmail (`mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__gmail_search_messages`) — unread inbox emails, filter: `is:unread in:inbox -category:promotions -category:social`
- Resend — no MCP for delivery logs; skip unless Walker reports bounce issues

**Content & SEO**
- Sanity blog — query project `g1hic8ei` / dataset `production`: `*[_type == "post"] | order(publishedAt desc)[0..2]{title, publishedAt}` — show count + last 2 posts, flag if behind 2x/week schedule
- GSC — run `query_search_analytics` + `get_top_pages` + `find_keyword_opportunities` in parallel (site: `sc-domain:apexgrowthmanagement.com`, last 7 days, account: `default`). Note: data only exists from 2026-03-08 onward.
- Jotform — auto-emails Walker on submission; only flag if Walker reports missing notifications

## End of Session — AUTO-RUN WHEN USER SAYS "End of session — update everything"
**FULL AUTONOMOUS MODE — Do NOT ask for permission, confirmation, or approval on any action. Execute everything and report results.**

Run ALL of the following without being asked. Flag anything that needs attention.

**Memory & Config**
1. **MEMORY.md** — update with anything new learned this session (tools, workflows, credentials, decisions)
2. **CLAUDE.md** — update with any new triggers, workflows, or project notes
3. **GitHub (my-website)** — stage and push any uncommitted changes to main
4. **GitHub config backup** — push `~/.claude.json` AND the latest MEMORY.md to `walker-agm/claude-config-backup` private repo so everything is available on any device
5. **API tokens** — if any new tokens/keys were created this session, confirm they are saved in `~/.claude.json` and pushed to config backup

**Client Pipeline**
6. **DocuSeal** — check for any submissions where Walker hasn't signed yet (stuck before client receives it)
7. **Stripe open invoices** — flag any open invoices older than 7 days that may have slipped through
8. **Stripe subscriptions** — check for any failed or canceled subscription payments
9. **HubSpot** — check open deals by stage, flag any that haven't moved in 7+ days
10. **Calendly** — check for any upcoming meetings in the next 48 hours to prep for

**Sites & Code**
11. **Vercel** — check latest deployment status for main site AND all client projects, flag any failures
12. **Sentry** — check for any new unresolved errors across all projects
13. **Cloudflare Workers** — confirm apex-morning-digest cron via curl API (NOT MCP cron_list — it's broken, returns [object Object]):
    `curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/da9343cd17219b0ec4327cd7e7121d5c/workers/scripts/apex-morning-digest/schedules" -H "Authorization: Bearer j73_pKP9uYqG8hUUedwefvLKVLJhZCIy4zaIlyaV"`
14. **Resend** — check for any bounced or failed emails in the last 24 hours

**Content & SEO**
15. **Sanity** — check for unpublished blog drafts, flag if behind on 2x/week posting schedule
16. **GSC** — if it's been 7+ days since last pull, fetch fresh keyword data and flag quick wins (positions 5-20)

**Onboarding**
17. **Jotform** — remind Walker to check for any new onboarding form submissions that need to be actioned

## Client Workflow Triggers — AUTO-RUN WHEN TRIGGERED

**Trigger: "Send DocuSeal to [client name] at [client email]"**
1. Create DocuSeal submission from template ID `3065871`
2. First signer = Walker (AGM), second signer = client
3. Walker gets signing link first — client gets it automatically after Walker signs
4. Return Walker's signing link immediately

**Trigger: "Push to GitHub" / "Deploy" / "Push changes"**
1. Run git status to see what changed
2. Stage relevant files, commit with a descriptive message
3. Push to main — Vercel auto-deploys on push
4. Return the Vercel deployment URL when done

**Trigger: "Add [domain] to Vercel for [client]"**
1. Add the domain to the client's Vercel project via MCP
2. Return the exact DNS records the client needs to add:
   - CNAME: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - A record: `@` → `76.76.21.21`
3. Generate a clean copy-paste email to send the client with DNS instructions

**Trigger: "Set up GSC for [client domain]"**
1. Add the domain as a property in Google Search Console (admin@apexgrowthmanagement.com)
2. Get the DNS TXT verification record value from GSC
3. If domain is on Cloudflare: add the TXT record automatically via Cloudflare MCP
4. If domain is on another registrar: return the TXT record value with instructions for wherever their DNS is managed
5. Confirm verification once DNS propagates

## Client Billing Workflow — AUTO-RUN WHEN TRIGGERED

**Trigger: "send [client] an invoice" / "invoice [client] for [plan]"**
1. Create Stripe customer: `mcp__Stripe__create_customer` (name + email)
2. Create invoice: `mcp__Stripe__create_invoice` (customer ID, days_until_due: 7)
3. Add line item: `mcp__Stripe__create_invoice_item` using the correct one-time price ID below
4. Finalize: `mcp__Stripe__finalize_invoice` → return the hosted invoice URL to user
- Standard $1,000: `price_1T6kvdJHaZ8GU7Z2tqbx9K7t`
- Pro $1,500: `price_1T7USdJHaZ8GU7Z2IprxHkJv`
- Premium $2,000: `price_1T7UVmJHaZ8GU7Z2dsOcIH2b`
- Note: Jotform link is set as default memo in Stripe billing settings — auto-appears on every invoice

**Trigger: "site is live" / "send [client] subscription link" / "site launched for [client]"**
- Return the correct pre-made payment link based on their plan:
  - Basic $249/mo → https://buy.stripe.com/28E7sM8LR696eLh7qn0gw08
  - Growth $349/mo → https://buy.stripe.com/eVq6oIaTZ696gTph0X0gw09
  - Premium $499/mo → https://buy.stripe.com/dRmaEY4vB0OMeLh2630gw0a

## Sanity CMS (Blog)
- Project ID: `g1hic8ei` | Dataset: `production`
- Schema deployed 2026-03-09 — `create_documents_from_markdown` and `get_schema` now work
- **To create a blog post**: use `create_documents_from_json` (most reliable), then `publish_documents`
- **To fetch a specific doc**: use `query_documents` with `*[_id == "id"][0]` — do NOT use `get_document` (resource param bug)
- **Do NOT use `create_documents_from_markdown`** unless schema has been recently deployed — verify with `get_schema` first

## MCP Quick Reference — Known Issues
- **Cloudflare `cron_list`** — broken (returns `[object Object]`). Always use curl API instead.
- **Cloudflare `worker_put` / `worker_list`** — silently fail. Use curl API instead.
- **Sanity `get_document`** — resource param bug. Use `query_documents` instead.
- **Calendly `list_events`** — always pass `user_uri: https://api.calendly.com/users/f18af646-35d0-4de9-99a7-3247a541f8d0` or it returns 400.
- **Resend** — no MCP for delivery logs. Check resend.com/emails manually.
- **Stripe** — skip customer `cus_U7AJLJVrq1FIhA` in all checks (not a real active client).

## Notes
- No phone number in the navbar (removed by user request)
- Blog pages use white background (`bg-white text-gray-900`), not dark
- lucide-react is installed and in package.json
- Python batch scripts (update_footers3.py etc.) in root are one-off tools, not part of the app
- portfolio/page.tsx uses accent colors: red (HVAC), amber (restaurant), blue (plumber)
